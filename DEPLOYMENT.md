# Live Polling System - Git Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Git-Based Deployment (Recommended)

Your Live Polling System is ready for deployment! Here's how to deploy it to Vercel using Git integration for continuous deployment:

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account  
- Vercel account
- Git repository (already initialized âœ…)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub** (go to github.com/new)
   - Repository name: `live-polling-system`
   - Set as Public or Private
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have files)

2. **Connect your local repo to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/live-polling-system.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username

### Step 2: Deploy with Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub

2. **Import Your Repository**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your `live-polling-system` repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it as a React app

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Build Command**: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `client/build`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will build and deploy automatically

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Deployment

Once set up, every push to your `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment!

```bash
# Make changes, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push origin main
# ðŸŽ‰ Auto-deploys to Vercel!
```

## ðŸ“± Alternative: CLI Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Vercel CLI installed: `npm i -g vercel`
- Vercel account

### Deployment Steps

1. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm run build && cd .. && vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Configure Environment (if needed)**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Navigate to your project settings
   - Add any environment variables

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Your Deployment

After deployment:

1. **Teacher Workflow**

   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Click "I'm a Teacher"
   - Create a poll with question and options
   - Start the poll and share session code

2. **Student Workflow**
   - Open your Vercel URL in new browser/incognito
   - Click "I'm a Student"
   - Enter session code and your name
   - Answer the poll when it's active

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

- **Socket.io connection issues**: Check browser console for CORS errors
- **Build failures**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Routing issues**: Vercel should handle client-side routing automatically
